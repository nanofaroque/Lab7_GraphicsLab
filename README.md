Objectives:

In this Lab, you'll create an application that displays, animates and manipulates Bubbles. The
application’s user interfaces will have a main display area that is initially empty as shown below.
When the user touches this empty screen, one new bubble should appear on the display As shown
below. The bubble should then begin to move around the screen. The Bubble’s size, direction and
speed should be randomized within limits explained in source code skeleton.
2
Assuming the Bubble’s initial direction is up and to the right, the Bubble shown above might be in the
location shown below after a couple seconds.
3
As the user continues to touch empty spaces on the screen, more bubbles should be added.
If the user presses the screen at a location already occupied by a bubble, then the bubble should “pop.”
That is, it should be removed from the screen and a bubble popping sound should be played. The sound
file is in the skeleton code in the /res/raw/bubble_pop.wav file.
In addition, if the user executes a "fling" gesture starting at a location already occupied on the screen,
then the application should change the bubbles current direction and speed to match the direction and
speed of the fling gesture.
